# State Management Examples

This directory contains example implementations of the achievements system with different state management solutions. Each example demonstrates how to integrate the achievements system with a specific state management approach.

## Available Examples

### [Redux](./redux)
Implementation using Redux with Redux Toolkit for state management. Suitable for large applications with complex state management needs.

### [Zustand](./zustand)
Implementation using Zustand, a lightweight state management solution. Perfect for small to medium-sized applications that need simple but powerful state management.

### [Context API](./context)
Implementation using React's built-in Context API with reducer pattern. Ideal for applications that want to avoid external dependencies and prefer React's native solutions.

## Choosing an Implementation

Choose the implementation that best fits your needs:

- **Redux**: Choose if you:
  - Already use Redux in your application
  - Need powerful dev tools and middleware
  - Have complex state management requirements
  - Want a well-established ecosystem

- **Zustand**: Choose if you:
  - Want a simpler alternative to Redux
  - Need minimal boilerplate
  - Want great TypeScript support
  - Prefer a more modern API

- **Context API**: Choose if you:
  - Want to avoid external dependencies
  - Have simpler state management needs
  - Prefer React's built-in solutions
  - Want the smallest possible bundle size

## Using the Examples

Each example directory contains:
- Implementation files
- A detailed README with usage instructions
- Type definitions and necessary utilities

To use an example:
1. Choose the implementation that best fits your needs
2. Follow the README in that implementation's directory
3. Copy the necessary files to your project
4. Install any required dependencies
5. Follow the usage instructions in the implementation's README
